# mapbox-gl-nsw-rfs-majorincidents

A NSW RFS Major Incidents Layer for Mapbox GL.

This module abstracts away all the details of adding a NSW RFS Major Incidents layer to your Mapbox GL JS map. The goal is to make something which works out of the box rather than having every aspect configurable.

It was written specifically to [add information about bushfires nearby bushwalks on BeyondTracks](https://www.beyondtracks.com).
